# Outline

30 &le; Goal Timing &le; 40

## Opening Remarks 

### Introduce myself. 

- Brevity is okay here. There's no need to go into detail, but explain who I am and how I know Kris and Alexia.
  - > Hello, everyone. For those of you who may not know, my name is Joshua Boehm; I've been a long time friend of both Kris and Alexia. It is for that reason that I've been honored to stand before you today. First, some quick business to attend to...

### Explain that photos are *<u>not allowed</u>* and explain why.

- They've hired fantastic photographers to capture these moments. More importantly, Kris and Alexia desperately want their guests (you all) to be present in this most critical moment of theirs.
  - > This ceremony is a reverent event to be experienced by those closest of friends. As such, Kris and Alexia have hired exceptional photographers to eternalize this day in the highest quality. Consequently, they request that you, please, refrain from taking any pictures from this point forward.
- Could joke: 
  - > If you feel compelled to take photos, I would be happy to model them for you just now, so that after, we can move on.
        
### Segue into turning off phones.

- > Now that you've got those beautiful photos taken, I would suggest that you either turn off your phones or put them on airplane mode It's just easier to avoid temptation, and will help keep my simple mind on track as we progress.
    
### Officially begin the processional.

- Perhaps as simply as "let's begin"
  - > Now that all of hard stuff is out of the way, let's begin!

## Processional

1. During this section of the wedding, the parties (family members and wedding party members) will all walk to their spots. 

2. Once this is done, if need be, <u>*remind everyone to stand*</u>; Alexia will walk down the aisle.

3. "Who gives this woman to be wedded to this man?"

4. Let everyone be seated.

## Wedding Officiant Speech

At this point, I will give a speech. Could include the following:

- Story of them
- A poem
- A reflection of love and/or marriage
- Anything else.

This is a time to be personal and engaging. I should bring everything about them into focus, leading up to the next section.
Anything else Kris and Alexia would like outside of what I think.

##  The Declaration of Intent and/or the less Personal Vows

### Declaration of Intent

This is a more legal-than-romantic statement that the to-be-wedded are of sound mind and are voluntarily here. 
This is the section of the ceremony that the bride and groom will repeat after me or simply respond to questions with <b><u>I WILL</u></b> or <b><u>I DO</u></b>. 
There are several different was for this to happen. [These are some examples of this sorts of statements.](https://officianteric.com/declaration-of-consent/)

### Vows

Kris and Alexia have agreed to do their vows privately, as they are very personal. They may choose to do some more public vows here. I may look for some.

##  The Exchange of the Wedding Rings

There may be a neat thing where the ring bearer will be a surpise &ndash; the rings would be under a certain seat of the front few rows i.e. special family members. Otherwise a ring bearer will bring them

There should be a few words spoken as to the significance and symbolism of the ring. Traditionally, it would have been the time to say "with this ring, I do thee wed".

- Maybe remark on how the rings are a symbolic manifestation of the vows they just made.
- Have first one, then the other (ladies first?) summarize those sentiments while placing the ring on the finger.

## The Pronouncement of the Couple

This is the home stretch. This is where I can say something in closing about them. This is the part where I say:

> With those rings, you have now symbollically bound yourselves to the vows you made to one other. As with all of your relationship prior and your marriage going forward, it is built by and dependant on **_love_**. And with that love, it is with great delight I, by the power vested in me by the Universal Life Church, pronounce you Husband and Wife; You may now kiss the bride!

### GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE PICTURE OR DIE

After the have done this, they can face the crowd with some excitement (give time for photos). Next, come the closing remarks.

## Closing Remarks

This may be a good time for the wife to get back her flowers from the Maid-of-Honor. It may also be a good time to tell people what to do as the newlyweds (and wedding party) leave the area.

- First, <u>**thank the guests for coming**</u>
- After they leave, there will be a cocktail hour in a particular area while they take some photos
- Stay in a particular area (I'm not sure where yet) while this happens
- **Have everyone rise as the couple walks out**

### After everyone is standing, announce them as the married couple:

> I now give you, for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Kristopher and Alexia Stolte!
