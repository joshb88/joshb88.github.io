> Consequently, I have a few things to share with you all on their behalf.
> They have ensured that fantastic photographers are here to immortalize each lovely moment of today, so that we all can simply enjoy.
> In the pursuit of being present, Kristopher and Alexia have requested that you refrain from taking any photos of your own.

You are all the very closest friends and family Kristopher and Alexia have; thank you all for understanding and helping to make this day as special as possible. And, with that, what do you say we get these two married?!

## Processional

There may not be too much said during this particular part. Just get the cue from Victor to know when to tell everyone to stand for Alexia.

As she arrives at Kris, ask her father, 

> Who gives this woman to be wedded to this man?

He will respond his name and then find his seat. At this point, tell everyone to be seated:

> Please, be seated.

## Wedding Officiant Speech

I bet there are still some of you who may be thinking, "who is this tall, goofy looking guy and why is he standing there?" As I mentioned before my name is Josh Boehm, and I've known Kristopher and Alexia since their beginning. For that reason, I have been honored to stand before you all today to facilitate the most beautiful day of their lives (so far).

Like so many stories, theirs isn't without intrigue or conflict, nor is with without passion, fun, and most importantly, love. They have very clearly trended towards something beautiful.

 First, I met Alexia over 10 years ago, and it didn't take long for us to grow as friends. She was as beautiful as she was fiery, and as fierce as she was compassionate; let me tell you: nothing has changed in that time. 

She's devoted to things she sees in her future, and more than capable of achieving them. She was the youngest proper manager at Japaneiro's I think there's ever been, and she succeeded at that roll as we all know her spirit demands. Sure, she may occasionally be on what my Cuban family call "island time", but with the grace she exhibits managing her life (and often lives around her), it's a testament to her character she manages to do anything. Because of her wonderful personality, I begain to see her as a brother would a sister: sharing pure, sometimes hard, truths delivered with love. 

A short time after Alexia and I began our friendship in earnest is when I met Kris. While he shared many of the amazing qualities any person seeks, his truly shining characteristics were much more complimentary to hers. He was clever, charming, and loved life more than anyone else I've met since; these too have only matured in the subsequent years. With his brightness, his capability,  and his competency, he too ascended the heirarchy of our job. He and I grew closer as friends as we both saw eye-to-eye on how to live life: with purpose and above all, with enjoyment.
