<p>30 ≤ Goal Timing ≤ 40</p>
<h2 id="opening-remarks">Opening Remarks</h2>
<h3 id="introduce-myself">Introduce myself</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brevity is okay here. There's no need to go into detail, but explain
who I am and how I know Kris and Alexia.
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Hello, everyone. For those of you who may not know, my name is Joshua
Boehm; I've been a long time friend of both Kris and Alexia. It is for
that reason that I've been honored to stand before you today. First,
some quick business to attend to…</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="explain-that-photos-are-not-allowed-and-explain-why">Explain
that photos are <em><u>not allowed</u></em> and explain why</h3>
<ul>
<li>They've hired fantastic photographers to capture these moments. More
importantly, Kris and Alexia desperately want their guests (you all) to
be present in this most critical moment of theirs.
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>This ceremony is a reverent event to be experienced by those closest
of friends. As such, Kris and Alexia have hired exceptional
photographers to eternalize this day in the highest quality.
Consequently, they request that you, please, refrain from taking any
pictures from this point forward.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Could joke:
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If you feel compelled to take photos, I would be happy to model them
for you just now, so that after, we can move on.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="segue-into-turning-off-phones">Segue into turning off
phones</h3>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Now that you've got those beautiful photos taken, I would suggest
that you either turn off your phones or put them on airplane mode It's
just easier to avoid temptation, and will help keep my simple mind on
track as we progress.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="talk-about-what-happens-after">Talk about what happens
after</h3>
<p>There will be a small cocktail hour while the happy couple goes off
to do photographs. Inform the guests where to go.</p>
<h3 id="officially-begin-the-processional">Officially begin the
processional</h3>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps as simply as “let's begin”
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Now that all of hard stuff is out of the way, let's begin!</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="processional">Processional</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>During this section of the wedding, the parties (family members
and wedding party members) will all walk to their spots.</p></li>
<li><p>Once this is done, if need be, <u><em>remind everyone to
stand</em></u>; Alexia will walk down the aisle.</p></li>
<li><p>“Who gives this woman to be wedded to this man?”</p></li>
<li><p>Let everyone be seated.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="wedding-officiant-speech">Wedding Officiant Speech</h2>
<p>This will take about 4-5 Minutes. It will segue into the Unity candle
section.</p>
<h2 id="unity-candle-ceremony">Unity Candle Ceremony</h2>
<p>This process will signify the start of their process.</p>
<h2 id="the-declaration-of-intent-andor-the-less-personal-vows">The
Declaration of Intent and/or the less Personal Vows</h2>
<h3 id="declaration-of-intent">Declaration of Intent</h3>
<p>This is a more legal-than-romantic statement that the to-be-wedded
are of sound mind and are voluntarily here. This is the section of the
ceremony that the bride and groom will repeat after me or simply respond
to questions with <b><u>I WILL</u></b> or <b><u>I DO</u></b>. There are
several different was for this to happen. <a
href="https://officianteric.com/declaration-of-consent/">These are some
examples of this sorts of statements.</a></p>
<h3 id="vows">Vows</h3>
<p>In lieu of vows (which will be shared privately), they have done the
unity candle.</p>
<h2 id="the-exchange-of-the-wedding-rings">The Exchange of the Wedding
Rings</h2>
<p>There may be a neat thing where the ring bearer will be a surprise –
the rings would be under a certain seat of the front few rows
i.e. special family members. Otherwise a ring bearer will bring them</p>
<p>There should be a few words spoken as to the significance and
symbolism of the ring. Traditionally, it would have been the time to say
“with this ring, I do thee wed”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe remark on how the rings are a symbolic manifestation of the
vows they just made.</li>
<li>Have first one, then the other (ladies first?) summarize those
sentiments while placing the ring on the finger.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-pronouncement-of-the-couple">The Pronouncement of the
Couple</h2>
<p>This is the home stretch. This is where I can say something in
closing about them. This is the part where I say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With those rings, you have now symbollically bound yourselves to the
vows you made to one other. As with all of your relationship prior and
your marriage going forward, it is built by and dependant on
<strong><em>love</em></strong>. And with that love, it is with great
delight I, by the power vested in me by the Universal Life Church,
pronounce you Husband and Wife; You may now kiss the bride!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="get-the-fuck-out-of-the-picture-or-die">GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE
PICTURE OR DIE</h3>
<p>After the have done this, they can face the crowd with some
excitement (give time for photos). Next, come the closing remarks.</p>
<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing Remarks</h2>
<p>This may be a good time for the wife to get back her flowers from the
Maid-of-Honor. It may also be a good time to tell people what to do as
the newlyweds (and wedding party) leave the area.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, <u><strong>thank the guests for coming</strong></u></li>
<li><s>After they leave, there will be a cocktail hour in a particular
area while they take some photos</s></li>
<li><s>Stay in a particular area (I'm not sure where yet) while this
happens</s></li>
<li><strong>Have everyone rise as the couple walks out</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3
id="after-everyone-is-standing-announce-them-as-the-married-couple">After
everyone is standing, announce them as the married couple</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I now give you, for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Kristopher and
Alexia Stolte!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="recessional">Recessional</h2>
<p>Everyone in the party will leave. When they have, the guests are free
to leave to the cocktail hour.</p>
