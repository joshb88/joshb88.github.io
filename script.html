<h2 id="opening-remarks">Opening Remarks</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, everyone. For those of you who may not know me well, my name
is Josh Boehm; I’ve been a a friend to both Kris and Alexia for nearly a
decade. For that reason, they have honored me to stand before you all
today to share in their most joyous day. Consequently, I have a few
things to share with you all on their behalf. They have ensured that
fantastic photographers are here to immortalize each lovely moment of
today, so that we all can simply enjoy. In the pursuit of being present,
Kristopher and Alexia have requested that you refrain from taking any
photos of your own. I know how hard it can be to avoid the temptation of
your phones. So, if you need, you can just snap a photo of me really
quickly, then kindly either turn your phones off or put them in airplane
mode.</p>

<p>Secondly, after the ceremony has concluded, Kristopher, Alexia, and
the wedding party will be taking some photos. During that time, there
will be a small cocktail hour outside. Please, enjoy yoursleves in [THAT
AREA] with some food, drinks, and amazing people.</p>
</details>
<p><br> You are all the very closest friends and family Kristopher and
Alexia have; thank you all for understanding and helping to make this
day as special as possible. And, with that, what do you say we get these
two married?!</p>
<h2 id="processional">Processional</h2>
<p>There may not be too much said during this particular part. Just get
the cue from Victor to know when to tell everyone to stand for
Alexia.</p>
<p>As she arrives at Kris, ask her father,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who gives this woman to be wedded to this man?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He will respond his name and then find his seat. At this point, tell
everyone to be seated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please, be seated.</p>

<p>I bet there are still some of you who may be thinking, “who is this
tall, goofy looking guy and why is he standing there?” I first met
Alexia over 10 years ago. She was as beautiful and fiery then as she is
now. Very quickly, we began to see each other like siblings would; pure
truth, and sometimes hard truths, delivered with love. <span

been dating someone for some time and she was lamenting over this
relationship like we all did in our youth.</span></p>
