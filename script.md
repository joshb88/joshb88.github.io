## Opening Remarks 
> Hello, everyone. For those of you who may not know me well, my name is Josh Boehm; I've been a a friend to both Kris and Alexia for nearly a decade. 
> For that reason, they have honored me to stand before you all today to share in their most joyous day. 
> Consequently, I have a few things to share with you all on their behalf.
> They have ensured that fantastic photographers are here to immortalize each lovely moment of today, so that we all can simply enjoy.
> In the pursuit of being present, Kristopher and Alexia have requested that you refrain from taking any photos of your own. 
> I know how hard it can be to avoid the temptation of your phones. 
> So, if you need, you can just snap a photo of me really quickly, then kindly either turn your phones off or put them in airplane mode.

    Secondly, after the ceremony has concluded,  Kristopher, Alexia, and the wedding party will be taking some photos. During that time, there will be a small cocktail hour outside. Please, enjoy yoursleves in [THAT AREA] with some food, drinks, and amazing people.

<br>
You are all the very closest friends and family Kristopher and Alexia have; thank you all for understanding and helping to make this day as special as possible. And, with that, what do you say we get these two married?!

## Processional

There may not be too much said during this particular part. Just get the cue from Victor to know when to tell everyone to stand for Alexia.

As she arrives at Kris, ask her father, 

> Who gives this woman to be wedded to this man?

He will respond his name and then find his seat. At this point, tell everyone to be seated:

> Please, be seated.

## Wedding Officiant Speech

I bet there are still some of you who may be thinking, "who is this tall, goofy looking guy and why is he standing there?"
I first met Alexia over 10 years ago. She was as beautiful and fiery then as she is now. 
Very quickly, we began to see each other like siblings would; pure truth, and sometimes hard truths, delivered with love.
