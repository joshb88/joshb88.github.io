## Opening Remarks

### Introduce myself. 

- Brevity is okay here. There's no need to go into detail, but explain who I am and how I know Kris and Alexia.
  - > Hello, everyone. For those of you who may not know, my name is Joshua Boehm; I've been a long time friend of both Kris and Alexia. It is for that reason that I've been honored to stand before you today. First, some quick business to attend to...

### Explain that photos are *<u>not allowed</u>* and explain why.

- They've hired fantastic photographers to capture these moments. More importantly, Kris and Alexia desperately want their guests (you all) to be present in this most critical moment of theirs.
  - > This ceremony is a reverent event to be experienced by those closest of friends. As such, Kris and Alexia have hired exceptional photographers to eternalize this day in the highest quality. Consequently, they request that you, please, refrain from taking any pictures from this point forward.
- Could joke: 
  - > If you feel compelled to take photos, I would be happy to model them for you just now, so that after, we can move on.
        
### Segue into turning off phones.

- > Now that you've got those beautiful photos taken, I would suggest that you either turn off your phones or put them on airplane mode It's just easier to avoid temptation, and will help keep my simple mind on track as we progress.
    
### Officially begin the processional.

- Perhaps as simply as "let's begin"
  - > Now that all of hard stuff is out of the way, let's begin!

## Processional

1. During this section of the wedding, the parties (family members and wedding party members) will all walk to their spots. 

2. Once this is done, if need be, <u>*remind everyone to stand*</u>; Alexia will walk down the aisle.

3. "Who gives this woman to be wedded to this man?"

4. Let everyone be seated.

## Wedding Officiant Speech

At this point, I will give a speech. Could include the following:

- Story of them
- A poem
- A reflection of love and/or marriage
- Any thing else.

A time to be personal and engaging. Anything else Kris and Alexia would like outside of what I think.

##  The Declaration of Intent and/or the less Personal Vows

### Declaration of Intent

This is a more legal-than-romantic statement that the to-be-wedded are of sound mind and are voluntarily here. 
This is the section of the ceremony that the bride and groom will repeat after me or simply respond to questions with <b><u>I WILL</u></b> or <b><u>I DO</u></b>. 
There are several different was for this to happen. [These are some examples of this sorts of statements.](https://officianteric.com/declaration-of-consent/)

### Vows

Kris and Alexia have agreed to do their vows privately, as they are very personal. They may choose to do some more public vows here. I may look for some.
