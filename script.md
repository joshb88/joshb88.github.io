# Opening Remarks

> Hello, everyone. For those of you who may not know me well, my name is Josh Boehm; I've been a a friend to both Kris and Alexia for nearly a decade.
> For that reason, they have honored me to stand before you all today to share in their most joyous day.
> Consequently, I have a few things to share with you all on their behalf.
> They have ensured that fantastic photographers are here to immortalize each lovely moment of today, so that we all can simply enjoy.
> In the pursuit of being present, Kristopher and Alexia have requested that you refrain from taking any photos of your own.
> I know how hard it can be to avoid the temptation of your phones.
> So, if you need, you can just snap a photo of me really quickly, then kindly either turn your phones off or put them in airplane mode.

    Secondly, after the ceremony has concluded,  Kristopher, Alexia, and the wedding party will be taking some photos. During that time, there will be a small cocktail hour outside. Please, enjoy yoursleves in [THAT AREA] with some food, drinks, and amazing people.

<br>
You are all the very closest friends and family Kristopher and Alexia have; thank you all for understanding and helping to make this day as special as possible. And, with that, what do you say we get these two married?!

# Processional

There may not be too much said during this particular part. Just get the cue from Victor to know when to tell everyone to stand for Alexia.

As she arrives at Kris, ask her father:

> Who gives this woman to be wedded to this man?

He will respond his name and then find his seat. At this point, tell everyone to be seated:

> Please, be seated.

# Wedding Officiant Speech

<spoiler>
I bet there are still some of you sitting there who may be thinking, "who is this tall, goofy looking guy and why is he officiating?" Well, as I mentioned before my name is Josh Boehm, and I've known Kristopher and Alexia since their beginning. For that reason, I have been honored to stand before you all today to facilitate the most beautiful day of their lives (so far).</spoiler>

<spoiler>Like so many stories, theirs isn't without intrigue, conflict or hardship, nor is with without passion, fun, and most importantly, love. They have very clearly trended towards something beautiful, which is why we gather here today.</spoiler>

<spoiler>First, I met Alexia over 10 years ago, and it didn't take long for us to grow as friends. She was as beautiful as she was fiery, and as fierce as she was compassionate; let me tell you: nothing has changed in that time.</spoiler>

<spoiler>She's devoted to the things she sees in her future, and she's more than capable of achieving them. She was the youngest manager at Japaneiro's I think there's ever been, and she's grown from that role as we all know her spirit demands. Sure, she may occasionally be on what my Cuban family call "island time", but with the grace she exhibits managing her life (and often the lives around her), it's a testament to her character she manages to do anything. Because of her wonderful personality, I begain to see her as a brother would a sister: sharing pure, sometimes hard, truths always delivered with love.</spoiler>

<spoiler>A short time after Alexia and I began our friendship in earnest is when I met Kris. While he shared many of the amazing qualities any person seeks, his truly shining characteristics were much more uniquely Kris. He was clever, charming, and loved life more than anyone else I've met since; these too have only matured in the subsequent years. There wasn't a day that went by where he wasn't cracking a joke, singing a song, or sharing a laugh. It was no wonder he progressed to where he is now. He and I grew closer as friends as we both saw eye-to-eye on how to live life: with purpose and, above all, passionate enjoyment.</spoiler>

<spoiler>Naturally, these two brilliant and, if I may say say, very attractive people begin sparking. How couldn't they? They have the most well-fitting complimentary strengths I've seen. Anyway, around that time, Alexia was in a transitional period of a relationship when she had finally confided in me, "Josh, he's soooo hot! What do I do?" As you can imagine, I encouraged her with the truth: "Yeah, I picked up on that.. If you like him, go talk to him!" What felt like immediately, some fateful night at Blu (I'm not sure which night it was; those of you who've been could imagine why) those sparks finally ignited into fierce flames. From that fateful moment until this one, those flames have flickered through the calm days and the stormy nights and everything in between until they steadied to a smolder that warms their souls.</spoiler>

<spoiler>
But as with a flame, your love will take care, work, and dedication. It's critical you both allow not just the other the room to grow, to breath, to flourish, but <i>yourselves</i>. There will be days that you each may need stoking; there will be days you both need more fuel. Just remember that from this day forward, you are both each other's keeper. May you tend to each other in such a way that you keep that warmth for all your lives.
</spoiler>

# Unity Candle

At this time, Kristopher and Alexia have elected to light a unity candle in lieu of publically sharing their private vows. This candle symbolizes that very flame. While you each should (and hopefully will) remain your own person. Part of being a great couple is to first be a great individual. It is with your *individual* flames that you both shall fuel your *joint* fire. Let the shared lighting of this candle symbolize the union you are making today, and have it serve as a reminder to the task ahead of you to cultivate your marriage.

> They will both light the candle together at this time.

# Declaration of Intent

# Ring Exchange

At this point, have them hold hands and get the rings from whomeover has them.

> <span style="background-color:rgba(180, 255, 225, 0.15);">KRISTOPHER</span>, as you place this ring on ALEXIA's finger, repeat after me.

He will get the ring ready

> "I give you this ring as a symbol of our love. Let it be a reminder that I am always by your side and that I will always be faithfully yours."

He places the ring on her finger.

> "I give you this ring as a symbol of our love. Let it be a reminder that I am always by your side and that I will always be faithfully yours."

# Pronouncement of the Couple

With those rings, you have now symbollically bound yourselves to
the vows you made to one other. As with all of your relationship
prior and your marriage going forward, it is built by and dependant
on love. And with that love, it is with great delight I, by the power
vested in me, pronounce you Husband
and Wife; You may now kiss the bride!

## Be stepping aside already
