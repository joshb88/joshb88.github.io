<h2 id="opening-remarks">Opening Remarks</h2>
<h3 id="introduce-myself.">Introduce myself.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brevity is okay here. There’s no need to go into detail, but explain
who I am and how I know Kris and Alexia.
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Hello, everyone. For those of you who may not know, my name is Joshua
Boehm; I’ve been a long time friend of both Kris and Alexia. It is for
that reason that I’ve been honored to stand before you today. First,
some quick business to attend to…</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="explain-that-photos-are-not-allowed-and-explain-why.">Explain
that photos are <em><u>not allowed</u></em> and explain why.</h3>
<ul>
<li>They’ve hired fantastic photographers to capture these moments. More
importantly, Kris and Alexia desperately want their guests (you all) to
be present in this most critical moment of theirs.
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>This ceremony is a reverent event to be experienced by those closest
of friends. As such, Kris and Alexia have hired exceptional
photographers to eternalize this day in the highest quality.
Consequently, they request that you, please, refrain from taking any
pictures from this point forward.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Could joke:
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If you feel compelled to take photos, I would be happy to model them
for you just now, so that after, we can move on.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="segue-into-turning-off-phones.">Segue into turning off
phones.</h3>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Now that you’ve got those beautiful photos taken, I would suggest
that you either turn off your phones or put them on airplane mode It’s
just easier to avoid temptation, and will help keep my simple mind on
track as we progress.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="officially-begin-the-processional.">Officially begin the
processional.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps as simply as “let’s begin”
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Now that all of hard stuff is out of the way, let’s begin!</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="processional">Processional</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>During this section of the wedding, the parties (family members
and wedding party members) will all walk to their spots.</p></li>
<li><p>Once this is done, if need be, <u><em>remind everyone to
stand</em></u>; Alexia will walk down the aisle.</p></li>
<li><p>“Who gives this woman to be wedded to this man?”</p></li>
<li><p>Let everyone be seated.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="wedding-officiant-speech">Wedding Officiant Speech</h2>
<p>At this point, I will give a speech. Could include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Story of them</li>
<li>A poem</li>
<li>A reflection of love and/or marriage</li>
<li>Any thing else.</li>
</ul>
<p>A time to be personal and engaging. Anything else Kris and Alexia
would like outside of what I think.</p>
<h2 id="the-declaration-of-intent-andor-the-less-personal-vows">The
Declaration of Intent and/or the less Personal Vows</h2>
<h3 id="declaration-of-intent">Declaration of Intent</h3>
<p>This is a more legal-than-romantic statement that the to-be-wedded
are of sound mind and are voluntarily here. This is the section of the
ceremony that the bride and groom will repeat after me or simply respond
to questions with <b><u>I WILL</u></b> or <b><u>I DO</u></b>. There are
several different was for this to happen. <a
href="https://officianteric.com/declaration-of-consent/">These are some
examples of this sorts of statements.</a></p>
<h3 id="vows">Vows</h3>
<p>Kris and Alexia have agreed to do their vows privately, as they are
very personal. They may choose to do some more public vows here. I may
look for some.</p>
