## Opening Remarks

1. Introduce myself. 
    - Brevity is okay here. There's no need to go into detail, but explain who I am and how I know Kris and Alexia.
        - > Hello, everyone. For those of you who may not know, my name is Joshua Boehm; I've been a long time friend of both Kris and Alexia. It is for that reason that I've been honored to stand before you today. First, some quick business to attend to...
2. Explain that photos are *<u>not allowed</u>* and explain why.
    - They've hired fantastic photographers to capture these moments. More importantly, Kris and Alexia desperately want their guests (you all) to be present in this most critical moment of theirs.
        - > This ceremony is a reverent event to be experienced by those closest of friends. As such, Kris and Alexia have hired exceptional photographers to eternalize this day in the highest quality. Consequently, they request that you, please, refrain from taking any pictures from this point forward.
    - Could joke: 
        - > If you feel compelled to take photos, I would be happy to model them for you just now, so that after, we can move on.
3. Segue into turning off phones. 
    - > Now that you've got those beautiful photos taken, I would suggest that you either turn off your phones or put them on airplane mode It's just easier to avoid temptation, and will help keep my simple mind on track as we progress.
4. Officially begin the processional.
    - Perhaps as simply as "let's begin"
        - > Now that all of hard stuff is out of the way, let's begin!
